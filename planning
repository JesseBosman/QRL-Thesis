Planning Project:

Totaal aantal weken: 25

Einddatum/Presentatie: 4-03

Inleveren definitieve versie bij 2e corrector: 19-02 (week 23)

Inleveren versie voor laatste feedback Evert: 12-02 (week 22)


Week 1 Planning:
- get tfq running (DONE)
- get ALICE permission
- write starter to Quantum Circuit theory thesis (DONE)
- finish Tensorflow Quantum notebooks, especially RL one (DONE)

Week 2 Planning:
- Get the fox in a hole game from unitary (aleksandar vragen) (DONE)
- start on REINFORCE code, take snippets from assignments (DONE)
- get class. REINFORCE working on Cartpole (DONE)
- start replicating quantum circuits from either a paper or tensorflow notebook (DONE)
- get q. REINFORCE working on Cartpole(DONE)
- Get TFQ running on alice with vscode and github
- rewrite Fox in a hole to environment for agent
- try with very basic encoding scheme (0 for not there, 1 for unsure, 2 for there)

Week 3 Planning:
- Create encoding scheme/ way to encorperate previous actions and states into decision (RNN, something else.)
- get RL working of CFIAH
- Get QRL working on CFIAH


Week 4 Planning:
- run QRL vs RL on CFIAH with N reps for stat. results
- put data, results, observations in kladversie thesis
- discuss results with evert

Week 5 Planning
- Perform the same comparison but then on the already implemented quantum version in the fox in a hole code
- write out the comparison
- finish next quantum version of the game
- write out comparison

Week 6 Planning:
- discuss with evert jan and alek about next steps: (try more versions of the game, Start investigating effect of changing the circuit -> [completely different layers, different amount of layers, etc], try to expand towards games with larger/compexer states such as atari or mujoco)
